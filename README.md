# T05ANIM
Animation system worked by OpeGL

To complile project you have to make virtual Disk 'X' by creating and launch that .bat file:
subst X: D:\DiskX

After that, you have to add 'TGRKIT' in your DiskX from that repository.

It was my big fault, that I didn't create a project file tree. I don't want to fix it now.
